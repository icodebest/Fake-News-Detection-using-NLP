# Fake News Detection Using NLP

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. With the increasing prevalence of misinformation, automated fake news detection has become a critical application of AI in the modern world. This project includes training a machine learning model on news datasets, building a robust NLP pipeline, and creating a web application for user interaction.

## How It Works  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization  
   - TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction.  

2. **Model Building**  
   - Trained a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or any advanced model) to classify news articles.  
   - Evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

3. **Web Application**  
   - Developed a user-friendly interface for users to input news content.  
   - The model predicts whether the input news is fake or real.
